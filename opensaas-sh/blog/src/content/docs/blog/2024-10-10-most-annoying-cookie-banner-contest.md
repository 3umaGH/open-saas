This hackathon is suppported by by [Open Saas](https://opensaas.sh) and [Wasp](https://wasp.sh).

## What kind of contest is this?

The goal here is simple: Make **THE MOST ANNOYING COOKIE BANNER** you can think of.

Cookie consent banners annoy us all. So we thought, why not have some fun with them? Here are a couple examples of what that might look like:

1. *The Cookie Consent Wheel of Fortune:*

2. *The ‚ÄúHit Enter When the Red Ball is Over the Accept Button to Consent‚Äù Banner:*

## Prizes

2 winners will receive a nice mechanical keyboard, an additional *annoying* gift, as well as a shoutout on our socials.

The 2 winners will be selected by:

- The Wasp team
- Our Community (Discord & Twitter)

The community will get a chance to vote in a battle royale style elimination tournament, where two banners will go head-to-head and the winner will advance to the next round.

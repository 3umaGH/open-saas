This hackathon is suppported by by [Open Saas](https://opensaas.sh) and [Wasp](https://wasp.sh).

## Can cookie consent banners get more annoying?

The goal here is simple: Make **THE MOST ANNOYING COOKIE BANNER** you can think of.

Cookie consent banners annoy us all. So we thought, "Why not have some fun with them?" 

Here are a couple examples of what that might look like:

1. *The Cookie Consent Wheel of Fortune:*
